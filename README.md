**Connect and build relationships with cats you love.**

Follow all the cats in your area. Share photos and information, Post freely and interact with others. Dedicate to a cat today!

Each and every one of us have a favorite cat moment to share. Even if you do not have a cat, a coincidental, yet magical encounter with a cat in your neighborhood may have lingered in your memory all this time. Cats are endearing animals that wander around freely and we often wonder where they are in our neighborhood. We took notice of this important curiosity and started a project to better understand and follow free / stray cats.

DediCats, We support the coexistence of cats and humans everywhere.
